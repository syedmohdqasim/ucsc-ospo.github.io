## Join us on campus Thursday, October 10 from 6-8pm, for a Hacktoberfest celebration, co-hosted by the UCSC Open Source Program Office and UCSC Girls Who Code! üëª 

Come learn why we think open source is a great way to build your technical portfolio, meet cool people, and have an impact on the world ‚Äì all at the same time. Plus, we‚Äôll talk about how you can make your first contribution, or find new projects to work on if you‚Äôre a seasoned contributor. 

‚Üí Event details and registration (free): https://events.mlh.io/events/11767-hacktoberfest-ucsc

You'll get a hands-on introduction to open source contribution, including:
- Making a GitHub account (if you don't already have one)
- Fast-tracked verification for student developer benefits (including free Codespaces and Copilot hours) 
- Making a simple PR (pull request)

We'll then talk about how you can keep this momentum going through contribution to Hacktoberfest projects throughout the month, even if you‚Äôve never contributed to an open source project before.

Already have open source experience? Then come help mentor new contributors and meet other open source community members from across campus! 

We‚Äôll also have fall-themed snacks, plus some very cool swag from our friends at GitHub and raffle prizes chosen by students, for students üèÜ
